### Interpreting Random Forests

[andosa/treeinterpreter](https://github.com/andosa/treeinterpreter "andosa/treeinterpreter")

> Package for interpreting scikit-learn's decision tree and random forest predictions. Allows decomposing each prediction into bias and feature contribution components as described in [http://blog.datadive.net/interpreting-random-forests/](http://blog.datadive.net/interpreting-random-forests/ "http://blog.datadive.net/interpreting-random-forests/"). For a dataset with `n` features, each prediction on the dataset is decomposed as `prediction = bias + feature_1_contribution + ... + feature_n_contribution`.
