&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I ask people, most seem to think bananas grow on trees. But they don’t, in either the literal or the figurative sense: in fact, they’re in danger of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium is a poor choice for blogging Nikitonsky Nov 12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many people choose Medium lately as their go-to platform to blog. Kind of like Blogger a while back, it just seems what everybody has been doing (unless you are really nit-picky and care enough to host your own thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And kind of like Blogger, Medium is a terrible thing for publishing. If you think about publishing an article, starting a blog or even just sharing a short rant on Medium, please consider what you’ll be putting your readers through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we can’t hear their soft rhythms - if we are to busy rushing about, waiting for thunderclaps of revelation, inspiration, and certainty - or if we can spot them but can’t nurture them into real advantages, then we might as well be blind to them.&lt;/p&gt;

If the first screen, an app greets you with is a subscription paywall, it makes you wonder why the author just didn’t ask you to pay right away. Maybe, some people would think otherwise, but to me, such tactics are a no-go. What follows is an immediate removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice to app makers: if you are not going to offer your users a way to test your app for free anyway, just ask for the money right away. It looks more professional, won’t lead to a letdown of user expectations and will put you right into the category of people who will appreciate your product for what it is - those willing to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Preslav Rachev</name></author><summary type="html"># If the first screen, an app greets you with is a subscription paywall, it makes you wonder why the author just didn’t ask you to pay right away.

I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlinconf-app/issues/51&quot;&gt;an issue&lt;/a&gt; on Guthub and decided to switch back to an old hobby of mine - generative art.
