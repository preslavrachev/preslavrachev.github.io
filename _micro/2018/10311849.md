Today, I finished my sixth half-marathon for this year. It was more of an accident, really. I had not intended to run the distance, but at one point of my run, I simply got lost. When I realized that I have strayed off my path for far too long, I decided to rather run all the way back. I almost always forget to bring money or my ticket with me while running, so, instead of risking getting caught, I ran all the way back.
