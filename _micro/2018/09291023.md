On the road again, going to visit Bremen for the first time in three years. A lot has changed in those three years. I remember the last time I left the main train station in Bremen, thinking I would perhaps never go back. Many things I simply wanted to put behind. And here I am, a few years later, a bit older, and hopefully, a bit wiser this time, eagerly awaiting the time when the train will reach the Bremen station again.

I am not coming back. At least, not in the foreseeable future. Munich is my home now. Yet, it is good to go back to the place where Iâ€™d spent five years during my 20s, and try to reflect on my past life with fresh eyes.

Until the rest of the journey, this book here will keep me company.
