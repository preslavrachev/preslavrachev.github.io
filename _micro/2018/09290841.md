I can’t believe that it is so difficult to find a keyboard for my iPad 2018 model. I mean, there are iPad-compatible keyboards out there and many good ones at that, but nothing used and well kept that one could reuse. I roamed through eBay and on different local classifieds sites, but I could really not find anything suitable. Either the keyboards don’t match the width and height of the iPad, or the ones that do, have hinges/slits that don’t match the thickness.

I have seen a lot of cheap and good iPad keyboards on eBay whose owners tried them once or twice, and decided that they are not going to use them anymore. All the keyboards I found are more or less stuck to the iPad model they were built for. It is such a waste, because there is nothing in a keyboard that should make it really unique.

Oh, well.
