OK, it was about time, I post some photos from my trip up North. 

I spent a couple of wonderful days in Bremen. It has been roughly three years since I moved to Munich, leaving behind quite a few unanswered questions and opened doors. So, three years later, it was about time I visit Bremen again, and experience it with fresh eyes.

It felt, as if time had stopped throughout this time. Nothing has really changed Bremen to a state in which I would not be able to associate with anymore. On the contrary, everything felt the way I had left it. 

Bremen has a certain (hippy) level of freedom of mind and casual behavior, which would hardly be socially accepted in Munich. This is by far what I am missing the most, and I am glad that the free spirit is still there.
