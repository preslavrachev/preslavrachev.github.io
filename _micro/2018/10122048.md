As soon as I came back from KotlinConf, I decided to grab and try to build the [conference](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlinconf-app) demo app. I want to use it as a foundation for an idea I have in mind. Yet, as soon as I downloaded it and tried to compile it, came the first problems. Gradle is not really able to download all the dependencies, mainly, when it comes to the iOS-specific Kotlin/Native ones. I posted [an issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlinconf-app/issues/51) on Guthub and decided to switch back to an old hobby of mine - generative art. I dusted off an old Processing  project of mine, and will try to make it more Kotlin-esque.

This tweet got me inspired to check out Processing again:
