I found a very well kept and cheap 2nd gen iPod Shuffle, and I thought I could be able to use it on my runs, instead of carrying my phone with me. I would really like, if there is an option to listen to my Audible audiobooks, but for this, the iPod has to support playing files in a particular order. Is this supported on the 2nd gen, or is it always random?
