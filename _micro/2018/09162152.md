John Gruber’s review of Apple’s recent event: https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/iphone_xs_xr_series_4_apple_watch_event.

I was glad to discover that John shares my opinion that the the Apple Watch 4 was really the star of the show.

> All three products (counting XS and XS Max as a single product in two sizes, which, as I’ll explain later, is how to think about them) are interesting, but to me, the Series 4 watch was the standout of the show. The XS and XR iPhones are refinements to the landmark X that was announced last year. The Series 4 watch is a landmark redesign.
