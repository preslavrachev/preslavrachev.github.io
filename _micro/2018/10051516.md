One of the things I really love about conferencing abroad, is that it presents a great opportunity to explore new places. Conferences are primarily for networking and learning new things. Yet, as well-versed individuals, we should pursue those two as much **outside** the conference room, as **inside** it.

During my lunch break today, I took a short lunch, put networking on hold, and went out to explore downtown Amsterdam. These photos are what came out of my walk. I enjoyed taking each and every one of them.
