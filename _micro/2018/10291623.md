If the first screen, an app greets you with is a subscription paywall, it makes you wonder why the author just didn't ask you to pay right away. Maybe, some people would think otherwise, but to me, such tactics are a no-go. What follows is an immediate removal. 

Advice to app makers: if you are not going to offer your users a way to test your app for free anyway, just ask for the money right away. It looks more professional, won't lead to a letdown of user expectations and will put you right into the category of people who will appreciate your product for what it is - those willing to pay for it.
