Ben Horrowitz seems right to me. It's the technology and its implications that matter. There will always be bad apples, just like in the case of the Dotcom Bubble. This does not change the fact that some of the Internet giants of today were built right during that era. The blockchain/crypto indistry is in the phase of intense battleground testing. Only a few will survive, and IMHO, those will drive the future frontier. As of today, I still remain a long-term optimist in the potential of the technology and its applications.
