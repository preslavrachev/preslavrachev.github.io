The photo on the top represents my heart's activity during a Saturday full of physical activity - having walked more than 15 km in total. The photo below represents a day at the job, consiting of mostly sitting behind the laptop and solving our company's issues. I am not going to get into details, which one of these is more detrimental to helth. I believe that the photo makes it pretty darn obvious.

I will just say this: STRESS KILLS!
