Good morning from the second day of KotlinConf ([#kotlinkonf18](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/KotlinConf18)), located in the beautiful city of Amsterdam. I wanted to start the day with a few panoramas I took just outside the central train station. I am hoping that they will convince you just how beautiful a sunny morning in central Amsterdam can be 😍

This is also a reminder to thank a colleague, who taught me how to take such pano shots without totally screwing them up 😀
