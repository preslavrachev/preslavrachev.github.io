In case I have not mentioned it before, I bought a new running watch the other day: a [Garmin Forerunner 235](https://amzn.to/2xo8pUN). I have used it for a couple of days now, and am still collecting feedback for a more thorough review. Today, I did my [first training run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1845165806) with it today, and overall, I feel satisfied with the quality of measurement.

Having used an Apple Watch almost exclusively for almost a year, I found measurement of both the wrist-based-HR, the activity sensor, and the GPS a little too jagged and uneven, but when smoothed out, it leads to an overall similar end as with the Apple Watch.

For those who decide to buy this watch, in 2018, it is still a viable option compared to the more modern (and more expensive) competitors. Make sure to read this through review from [DC Rainmaker](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2015/11/garmin-fr230-fr235-review.html), written back in 2015.
