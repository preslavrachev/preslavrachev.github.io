My parents came over to Germany for Easter, and we used the quiet time for some traveling and walking around. With my OnePlus 3 always in my pocket, I snapped a few photos. For some of the them I used my favorite [multiple-exposure camera app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.almalence.hdr_plus), for others, just the standard camera app with HDR turned on. I only wish the weather were one idea better, but some photos came out quite nicely, despite the rain and clouds.
