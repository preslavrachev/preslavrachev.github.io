The end of every year usually gets me thinking and recollecting, and 2017 makes no difference. 

I'd like to start with a quote from [*Switch*](http://amzn.to/2zSF3gf):

> Former UCLA coach John Wooden, 12 one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all time, once said, “When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur …. Don’t look for the quick, big improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That’s the only way it happens—and when it happens, it lasts.”

The hardest thing for modern-day creators is picking an idea and sticking to it for a reasonable while. I guess, it has to do with the fast-moving pace of the world today, and the fear that no single idea is worthwhile enough to pursue untill the end. The reality though is that constant context-switching clogs the brain, and it starts producing, even more, ideas in search of a way out. This would have all been fine, had there been someone to sit down and pursue those ideas to an end. Being what behavioral psychologists call a [Debater](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality), I know this firsthand. I love what I do and I am especially grateful for the fact that I have the chance to work on and discover new things almost on a daily basis. Yet, I just can't help but marvel at all the things that humanity has built, which have withstood the test of time. Culture, literature, architecture, music, visual arts, you name it. I am sure that there has been a lot of early-on experimentation in all of these areas too, yet the works that have survived until today, are the ones that their creators set out and brought to an end.

In the closing hours of this year, I want to look at 2018 as a new year full of exciting opportunities, but also a year of bringing together all the bits and pieces I have started this year into something substantial. Someone that I will be really proud of. Something that will withstand the test of time.
