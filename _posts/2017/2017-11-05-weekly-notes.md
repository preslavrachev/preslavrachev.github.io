### Cryptocurrencies
According to [CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com), Bj√∂rk has recently [announced](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bjorks-latest-album-available-only-with-cryptocurrencies-shows-adoption) that her latest album, "Utopia", will be available exclusively after a purchase using cryptocurrencies.
