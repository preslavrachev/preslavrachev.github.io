Wow, it has been quite a week! It is time for a quick photo recap.

First, a [visit to Bremen](https://preslav.me/micro/2018/10032205/), the place where I studied my Master’s and lived for five years. I hadn’t visited the place for three years, so this was quite an emotional thing. I also managed to meet friends from the good old Uni days.

Having stayed only a couple of days, I took the train to [Utrecht, The Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randstad?wprov=sfti1), where I stayed at a friend’s house and used Utrecht as my base point during the two days of KotlinConf. Utrecht is a great place to live, because it is quiet and peaceful, but large enough that you won’t ever miss a thing. At the same time, its proximity to Amsterdam (a 25 min train ride) makes it a perfect residence for many commuters working in Amsterdam.

During one of the days, we checked an exhibition depicting the history of music-making machines.

We also traveled up north to [Enkhuizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enkhuizen?wprov=sfti1), a small seaside town that hosts a unique open [museum](https://www.zuiderzeemuseum.nl/). The museum depicts the life of the Dutch people between the 19th and 20th century.

But the journey does not stop here. The following couple of days, I took the early train to Amsterdam, where I attended this year’s [KotlinConf](https://kotlinconf.com/) conference. KotlinConf is quite a thing and deserves its own separate post. For now, I would just note  that it was great to meet so many people in person, many of which I follow online, and whose work I greatly admire. It was a great forum.

Only a day after my return to Munich, I visited a concert by [Maluma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluma_(singer)
