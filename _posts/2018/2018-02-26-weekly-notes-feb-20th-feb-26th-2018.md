I wasn't very active this week. During the week, I was mostly busy with the usual company stuff. Just as I was making plans for the week, a terrible cold knocked me out for the bigger part of the last 48hrs. Therefore, this will be more of a bits-and-pieces post, with links and quotes from stuff my dizzying head noted down, at the times when I could keep myself awake enough to be able to read.

OK, this wasn't entirely true. I did write a [short blog post](http://www.preslav.me/2018/02/25/one-thing-you-should-know-when-trading-altcoins-against-btc-or-eth/) on how to read charting data when trading one cryptocurrency against another.

I also prepared a small [demonstration](https://github.com/preslavrachev/spring-cloud-config-demo) of [Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/) for work purposes. The demo project contains a simple Kotlin-based Spring Boot client, reading its property configuration out of a config server. The config server is able to connect to a git repository containing only property configurations. It provides plain-text properties as well as allows for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data (e.g. DB passwords) on the fly. The demo project is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/preslavrachev/spring-cloud-config-demo) for everyone to check out and try.

This week was the official Lisk relaunch. The event took place in Berlin and was [broadcasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNoL4IE8GqI) on YouTube to a lot of anticipation from the community. The idea of the event was to bring Lisk closer to the mainstream crypto-community, by reducing the barriers to entry, and providing a visually nicer guided experience for newcomers. As of yet, the official v1.0 of the Lisk SDK is still expected to be released within the next couple of months, so the timing of this rebranding event was chosen very carefully. You can read about the major milestones covered by relaunch event [here](https://blog.lisk.io/recap-analysis-lisk-relaunch-night-383e94084a49). For now, I would like to finish with a quote which left a big impression on me, and is generally on par with my philosophy that cryptocurrencies should be in service of the people, not the other way around:

### Reducing Bitcoin transaction prices
Quite a bunch of news coming from different sides that all mention bringing Bitcoin transaction fees down. I find this very reassuring:

> Batching, a process by which multiple transactions are bundled into one TXID to be collectively transferred on the blockchain, significantly reduces the aggregate number ofBitcoin transactions on the network

via [ShapeShift (2% of Bitcoin Network) is Now Batching Transactions](https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2018/02/22/shapeshift-now-batching-bitcoin-transactions)


> In an attempt to tackle expensive bitcoin transaction fees and slow processing times, two leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase and Bitfinex, announced Tuesday they have rolled out a software update that they hope will address mounting concerns.

### Other Quotes

> Yet somehow arguments grounded in production code are rare. Few people seem willing to lift the curtain on such codebases, which is a damn shame. Because thatâ€™s where the real wisdom is buried. Thatâ€™s where people have been forced to make actual trade-offs between competing patterns and practices. Itâ€™s those trade-offs and the circumstances around them that are valuable.
