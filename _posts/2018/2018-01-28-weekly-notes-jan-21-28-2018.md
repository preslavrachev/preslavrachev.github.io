It was quite an eventful week. 

To start with, I got a side gig at the job, working on our company's [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/check24/id719610089?l=en&mt=8). I had shared my personal interest to work on iOS a while ago, and I did not hesistate to grab the opportunity when it appeared. With already more than two years of backend developer experience across our products, I think I will be able to contribute with a lot of deep domain expertise inide the app team. At the same, I am hoping to learn as much of the nitty-gritty intrinsics of the iOS platform. I am a data-passionate backend developer by heart and experience, and so will I remain. Yet, I am also a firm believer in the eye-opening potential of learning new things, so opportunities like this are always welcome.

<small>_Note:_ A great way to explore the capabilities of the CALayer by playing out wit the different types of layers provided by Core Graphics, is an iOS app called *[Layer Player](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/layer-player/id949768742?mt=8)*. The app is also open-source and its source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/raywenderlich/LayerPlayer).</small>

After the initial fanfares, I threw myself deep down the rabbit hole of managing complex [UIView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview) hierearchies, [animating and switching between different AutoLayout constraint hierarchies](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/218/), [CALayer masking](https://www.raywenderlich.com/169004/calayer-tutorial-ios-getting-started), etc. I hadn't done so much core graphics stuff since 2009/2010, when I worked on Flash/Flex UIs.

This week, I visited the [Hacking Machine Learning meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Hacking-Machine-Learning/) in Munich, organised and hosted by [Stylight](https://www.stylight.de). It is a nice opportunity to meet like-minded people passionate about data, and hear about their expereinces. I am thinking about submitting a talk proposal, where I will talk about my experiences trying to beat the cryptocurreny markets with machine learning techniques.

On the meetup, I heard about a machine learning conference in Prague - [MLPrague](https://www.mlprague.com). I would love to visit, but only for one day. I will try to ask the organizers, but I am also willing to buy and share a ticket (if it works). If anyone is interested, pelase, write in the comments or send me a message.

Speaking of conferences and other events, next week I will be visiting the [Elastic{ON} Tour in Munich](http://www.elastic.co/elasticon/tour/2017/munich), as well as the [Swift Lightning Talks Munich](https://www.meetup.com/The-Munich-iOS-Developers-Meetup/events/245824022/) meetup, this time organized and hosted by my company, [CHECK24](https://check24.de). In case you happen to be visiting any of them and want to catch up, send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev).
