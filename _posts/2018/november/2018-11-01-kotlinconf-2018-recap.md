[KotlinConf 2018](https://kotlinconf.com/) took place in beautiful Amsterdam at the beginning of October, and this year, I had the chance to attend. Though only the second edition, KotlinConf has already become something of an institution within the developer community. Events like these help you meet the people whose work you admire, but would otherwise not be able to meet in person.

This is my short recollection of the two wonderful days in Amsterdam:

## The Announcements
> We ❤️ Kotlin and Kotlin ❤️s us too!

### Kotlin 1.3
The long-awaited [Kotlin 1.3](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2018/10/kotlin-1-3/) release was announced, which would supposedly remove the “experimental” flag off of coroutines and make it a first-class language feature. It will also help promote the concept of multi-platform programming forward. Using Kotlin to develop backend systems is not a new idea, but the 1.3 release is going to firmly set foot in many domains, beyond Android.

Best of all, we can finally use one IDE to develop on Kotlin for all platforms. We no longer need to jump back and forth over to CLion or AppCode, unless we really want to. Otherwise, IntelliJ (incl. the free Community Edition) should be more than sufficient. For finalizing the iOS builds, we ultimately still need XCode, but that’s not something under JetBrains’ control.

## The Topics
> There is a DSL for that…

Of course, topics revolved mainly around the major announcements, including, but not limited to, the development of DSLs (domain-specific languages) for solving just about any problem, multi-platform development (for the JVM, JavaScript, or natively on iOS, macOS, Linux, etc), server-side, data science and machine learning, and of course, many, many sessions targeting Android.

### Kotlin on the Server
I was happy to see the [involvement of Google into Kotlin](https://cloud.google.com/kotlin/), beyond Android. In fact, there was quite a Google presence from the Cloud Platform team. Other companies, well-known using Kotlin on the server-side, such as German online-bank [N26](https://n26.com/), were there to inspire the community.

If you are interested into trying out Kotlin on the server, I recommend these three talks straight out of KotlinConf:
